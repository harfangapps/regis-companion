# TODOs

- Write launchd configuration file

## Guidelines

* Subcommand to register itself as launchd service, confirm executable location (or test if absolute path is necessary)
  - See also `brew services`, do similar to redis brew recipe.

* Have a good, simple update flow
  - Ideally, a custom homebrew recipe, so `brew update && brew upgrade redis-companion` works.
  - http://docs.brew.sh/brew-tap.html
  - Support manual download of binary too.
  - Regis could check for companion updates and display a message when a new version is available.

* Test logging via launchd, seems to output in /var/log/system.log?
  - Do the same as the Regis homebrew recipe, writes logs to files
