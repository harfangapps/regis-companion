# TODOs

## Guidelines

* Subcommand to register itself as launchd service, confirm executable location (or test if absolute path is necessary)
  - Or at least generate a skeleton plist file.

* Have a good, simple update flow
  - Support manual download of binary too.
  - Regis could check for companion updates and display a message when a new version is available.
