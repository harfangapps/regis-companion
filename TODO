# TODOs

* Listen only on local/loopback interface by default (127.0.0.1)
* Check what permissions the unix sockets should have
* Hash of remote/server addresses for unix socket, or that makes it predictable so unsafe?
* Subcommand to register itself as launchd service, confirm executable location (or test if absolute path is necessary)
* Have a good, simple update flow
* Use context.Context everywhere
* Use timeouts to close idle connections after a while
* Clean-up any resource on exit
* Test logging via launchd, seems to output in /var/log/system.log?
* Expvars exported via a command for introspection
